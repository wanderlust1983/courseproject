1st Column: Subject 

Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30

2nd Column:Activity

The six activites each participants of the experiment performs: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

3rd column - 68th column are all columns that measures the mean and standard deviation of the data

In genearl: 

t stands for time

X stands for X-axis

Y stands for Y-axis

Z stands for Z-axis

std stands for standard deviation

mag is short for magnititude
